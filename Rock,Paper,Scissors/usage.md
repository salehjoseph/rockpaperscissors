## How to Run the Project

Follow these steps to run the Rock, Paper, Scissors game on your local machine:

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have a web browser installed (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
- You should have a text editor (e.g., VS Code, Sublime Text) if you want to view or modify the code.

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Run the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/rock-paper-scissors.git
     ```
   - Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   - Change into the directory of the cloned repository:
     ```bash
     cd rock-paper-scissors
     ```

3. **Open the `index.html` File:**
   - Locate the `index.html` file in the project directory.
   - You can open this file directly in your web browser by double-clicking it or by using your browser's "Open File" feature.
   - Alternatively, you can run the following command if you're using the terminal:
     ```bash
     open index.html
     ```
   - On Windows, use:
     ```bash
     start index.html
     ```

4. **Play the Game:**
   - Once the `index.html` file is open in your browser, you can start playing the Rock, Paper, Scissors game.
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors, and see if you can beat the computer!

5. **Modify the Code (Optional):**
   - If you want to customize the game, open the project files in your preferred text editor.
   - Make changes to the HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files, and save your changes.
   - Refresh the browser to see your changes in action.

### Resetting the Game

- If you want to reset the game during play, click the "Reset Game" button that appears after a winner is declared.

### Troubleshooting

- If the game does not load correctly, ensure that all files are in the same directory and that there are no syntax errors in the code.

### Additional Notes

- No additional installations or configurations are required to run this project. It runs entirely in the browser using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
